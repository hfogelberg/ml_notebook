    "# RNN\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks are the edge are of machine learning and there is a lot of research still going on. In comparison to the human brain RNNs are the short term memory. A hidden layer passes on information to the next step, which in essence means in the future. That way the next step will \"remember\" what has previously happened.<br>\n",
    "![RNN 2](img/rnn2.png)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Examples of usage are:\n",
    "1. Generating sentences to describe an image (one to many).\n",
    "2. Determening if a sentance is positive or negative (many to one).\n",
    "3. Translating languages (many to many). \n",
    "4. Subtitle movies or describe what is happening (many to many).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The movie [Sunspring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY7x2Ihqjmc) was written by an RNN.\n",

    "## LSTM\n",
    "LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is the most popular type of RNN and mainly used today. "
